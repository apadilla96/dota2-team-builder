<p>This is something Iâ€™ve been wanting to do for a while. A graph of the time data now appears based on your selection on the homepage to give you an idea of how well your team will perform as the game goes on.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Nathan Lapp who finally did what I was too lazy to do.</p>

<p>For now the original time data page is still available, for those of you who were using it separately. I plan on tweaking the homepage UI a bit now, since I suspect typing hero names is generally easier than trying to find the pictures.</p>
